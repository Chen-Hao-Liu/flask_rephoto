# [Project RePhoto](https://chliu.pythonanywhere.com/)

[rePhoto](https://chliu.pythonanywhere.com/) is a website that makes this easier, so you (or a group!) can align and take many pictures of a place or an object. These pictures are a visual record of change -- pictures of trees or streams or beaches over time are useful to measure the effects of erosion and climate change; pictures of home improvement projects (or even yourself) can serve as a visual timeline of events.
