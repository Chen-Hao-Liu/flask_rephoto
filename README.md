# [Start Bootstrap - Clean Blog](chliu.pythonanywhere.com)

[rePhoto](chliu.pythonanywhere.com) is a website that makes this easier, so you (or a group!) can align and take many pictures of a place or an object. These pictures are a visual record of change -- pictures of trees or streams or beaches over time are useful to measure the effects of erosion and climate change; pictures of home improvement projects (or even yourself) can serve as a visual timeline of events.
